    title: "Love and Pain",
    content: `You just don't understand what it is to suffer until you've been on your knees, struggling to get some air into your lungs as the hurt they've caused you constricts your throat like a noose, squeezing out every sliver of hope left in you to survive. Often, people get away with hurting you. So easily. But as a victim, you're left by yourself crawling to discover mechanisms to cope through. We live in an oddly built world where if you speak out loudly about your hurt, you're labelled weak or attention seeking and if you bury it silently without having to deal with it, you're labelled a coward.

Love - the cause of all hurt. If you don't love, you can't be hurt. But if you aren't loved, then you certainly are hurting. It makes you shut out everything and everyone for so long that the empty feeling of vulnerability sweeps across your chest every now and then, reminding you of what usually follows close behind love- pain. Pain is the root of all anguish. Pain is what pushes you to an edge. You stand on the edge of the cliff, praying that someone will find you and stop you from the free fall at the same time wishing that no one is there to witness your spiral. Pain is a paradox within itself. As various situations roll out in front of you at your lowest, the pain chips at your soul piece by piece and continues to feed off of it until there's no distinct piece of you as an individual left. You have no idea running through your mind except praying that it's not too late to climb back. The mediocre existence of the flesh seems to be in vain when you lose what makes you YOU. As hurt storms into your life without your knowledge, knocking down the walls you've built around your heart and trying to rear its head and prove its presence at every step of your way, it makes you lose hope. And loss of hope means the death of the soul.`

    title: "Cosmic Serendipity",
    content: `As the setting sun paints the sky pink,
I blow tenderly on my diary to dry the ink
Beautiful phrases drip down my pen 
As I reminisce the glimpses of heaven 
I look at the clouds and ask myself
Is there anything more beautiful than this?
My skin replies, "His touch, my darling"
"The touch that glides so tenderly"

Solitude surrounds the dark night
As the headlights of his car glow bright 
The midnight skies come alive 
As the love equations we derive
I look at the moon and ask myself
Is there anything more beautiful than this?
My eyes reply, "His smile, my darling"
"The smile that intoxicates you so warmly"

A love so theoretical, a chemistry so rhetorical
An obsession so twisted; an addiction so hardly resisted
Falling, drowning and fiending...
In this cosmic serendipity, 
I find hope and its meaning`

  morphedLove: {
    title: "Morphed Love",
    content: `Hungry for one more of the devil's kiss
Gladly satiated in the erotic bliss
Like the softest caress of a feather 
He touches me and I wither...

As these feelings push me off the cliff
I plunge into oblivion as I catch his whiff 
Trusting his arms to catch me in the dive
Hoping my rotten heart is now alive

Kissing under the stars that barely glow
A language only our hearts know
A passion only our souls recognise 
Undying devotion for him, I now realise

This fire burning between him and me
So, is this how love is supposed to be?`

  femininePower: {
    title: "Feminine Power",
    content: `Born as a baby girl,
To be a woman I am raised,
Deeply loved, cared and embraced...

Yet, not all places were a haven...
Groped on the streets,
Enslaved on the sheets,
Belittled in the crowd,
Fear of being wrapped in the shroud...
I screamed and begged everyone in my view
To come for my rescue

And when no one did,
I stood on my own feet
I held my head high, shoulders squared
I've taught myself, for nothing I shall be afraid
I'm a wizard, I'm the magic
I'm the moment, I'm unique

There's nothing in this world as special as a woman
We hold the power to bring in lives
We are not just meant to be mere wives
In being a woman, I take vanity
We become tough, learning from calamity`

  hellsFury: {
    title: "Hell's Fury",
    content: `I have loved you from the start
Miles of distance never kept us apart
Waiting for you with presumed opinion
My mind slipping into innocent oblivion

And now you say you never loved me 
All the infatuation was just an illusion 
You've filled my mind with commotion

Yet...
You aren't too late to find your next prey 
And I see red when I see her hips sway 
Your hands explore her in front of me 
And I want to explode because it isn't me

This is all a game to you
And I should have warned
Darling, I bet you never knew
Hell, hath no fury like a woman scorned`

  yearning: {
    title: "When My Yearning Found a Home",
    content: `I've waited for you for so long
A trepidant yearning for where I belong
As hopelessness now earns a quick demise 
I find my home in the depths of your eyes

And now we're looking at the same moon 
We're kissing under the same stars
You're holding me here in your arms
As you trail sweet kisses over my palms

Writing poems on my skin with your tongue
Marking me yours as you grip my hip 
Like the filthiest lyrics in the sweetest song 
All of my carnal screams you lazily sip

I would empty my veins for you to fill me
I drown in your touch and I forget to breathe
Pawns of cosmic destiny, you've found me
This little soul of mine, for you, I unsheathe`

  fireAndIce: {
    title: "The Song of Fire and Ice",
    content: `They don't see what I see when I look into your eyes
The fire inside you burnS my soul like a surprise

Always the poet, but never the muse
But under your gaze, I turn into poetry
Always a want, but never the need 
But within your touch, I find an alchemy

Whispered promises under the stars
Filthy desires erasing my scars
With a passion that transcends all acrimony
Our bodies collide in a perfect symphony 

They don't see what I see when I look into your eyes
You and I forever dance to the song of fire and ice`

  fickleHeart: {
    title: "Fickle, Frail Heart",
    content: `Oh fickle, frail heart
You'll never learn
The love that you chase
Will only let you burn

The world is never ready for the way you love
So full passion and a blazing intensity
The world can never measure the way you love 
So full of warmth and a searing absurdity 

There is love in holding,
There is love in letting go...
So sometimes I hold him like he's the air I breathe,
And sometimes I let go because it hurts like a knife out of sheath...

And so, when I say I love you, 
He'll never fathom its weight 
For a love like this,
An eternity is worth the wait...`

  oneNight: {
    title: "One Night of Bliss",
    content: `Let's kiss for once and say goodbye
I'd want to see you again 
But my desires will feel awry

Skeptic hearts trying to get a feel
You look at me and my layers start to peel
Unsteady hands trying to steal a hold
You touch me and my dreams turn to real

With a passion that burns my soul
One night of bliss, we get high on the roll
Let's make love and say goodbye
The ghost of our intimacy
I'll forever testify`

  unquenchedFire: {
    title: "Unquenched Fire",
    content: `Into the eternal void of darkness
As the smoke flows out of my lips
Feral thoughts, hard to harness
Cause a familiar tingling in my hips

I shut my eyes, breathe in and out deeply
Willing myself not to surrender 
To those stealthy thoughts creeping slowly

Engulfed within the crutches of lonesome
I stand alone on the verge of falling
Overwhelming chills, warmth defying
I keep thinking all the time and then some

I burn with fire
A passion that fills my entire
But your absence pours down
In your memories, I'll forever drown`
